# Recipe Ratings Unveiled: Predicting Success Through Steps, Time, and Ingredients
Author: Norah Kerendian

## Introduction
Provide an introduction to your dataset, and clearly state the one question your project is centered around. Why should readers of your website care about the dataset and your question specifically? Report the number of rows in the dataset, the names of the columns that are relevant to your question, and descriptions of those relevant columns.


## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning
Describe, in detail, the data cleaning steps you took and how they affected your analyses. The steps should be explained in reference to the data generating process. Show the head of your cleaned DataFrame (see Part 2: Report for instructions).

### Univariate Analysis
Embed at least one plotly plot you created in your notebook that displays the distribution of a single column (see Part 2: Report for instructions). Include a 1-2 sentence explanation about your plot, making sure to describe and interpret any trends present. (Your notebook will likely have more visualizations than your website, and that’s fine. Feel free to embed more than one univariate visualization in your website if you’d like, but make sure that each embedded plot is accompanied by a description.)


### Bivariate Analysis
Embed at least one plotly plot that displays the relationship between two columns. Include a 1-2 sentence explanation about your plot, making sure to describe and interpret any trends present. (Your notebook will likely have more visualizations than your website, and that’s fine. Feel free to embed more than one bivariate visualization in your website if you’d like, but make sure that each embedded plot is accompanied by a description.)


### Interesting Aggregates
Embed at least one grouped table or pivot table in your website and explain its significance.


## Assessment of Missingness

### NMAR Analysis
State whether you believe there is a column in your dataset that is NMAR. Explain your reasoning and any additional data you might want to obtain that could explain the missingness (thereby making it MAR). Make sure to explicitly use the term “NMAR.”


### Missingness Dependency
Present and interpret the results of your missingness permutation tests with respect to your data and question. Embed a plotly plot related to your missingness exploration; ideas include:
• The distribution of column 
Y
 when column 
X
 is missing and the distribution of column 
Y
 when column 
X
 is not missing, as was done in Lecture 8.
• The empirical distribution of the test statistic used in one of your permutation tests, along with the observed statistic.
